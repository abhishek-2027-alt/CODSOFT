Titanic Survival Prediction 

This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not. The dataset includes details such as passenger age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more.

 Project Overview:-

Goal: Predict passenger survival on the Titanic.

Dataset: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Techniques Used: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning classification models.

Models Tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and more.

 Features Used:-

Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Sex: Gender of passenger

Age: Passenger age

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard

Fare: Ticket fare

Embarked: Port of embarkation

Steps in the Project:-

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing survival rates by age, gender, and class.

Feature Engineering – Creating new features (e.g., family size, title extraction).

Model Building – Training different ML models.

Evaluation – Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tech Stack:-

Python 

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models
